# Database Documentation Guide

This guide will help you structure the database section of your project documentation, ensuring clarity and precision, especially given your use of Firebase.

## 1. Conceptual Data Model (Visual Overview)

This section provides a high-level, visual understanding of how your data entities relate to each other. It's excellent for anyone (technical or non-technical) to quickly grasp the system's data structure.

### What to include:
*   The **image generated from the `ERD.md` file**.
    *   **Why:** This is your Entity-Relationship Diagram. It illustrates the main entities (like Users, Products, Orders) and the relationships between them in a database-agnostic way. It's the "big picture."

## 2. Detailed Database Schema (Implementation Details)

This section details the exact structure of your data as it will be implemented in your Firebase database. This is crucial for developers who need to understand the precise names, types, and organization of your data.

### What to include:
*   **Descriptions of your Firebase Collections and Document Structures.**
    *   **Why:** This represents your actual "database schema" for Firebase. You should use the information from the `database_schema.json` file.
    *   **Formatting:** Instead of simply pasting the raw JSON, present this information in a clear, readable format. A common approach is to use tables within your Markdown document for each collection.

#### Example Format for a Collection:

**`users` Collection**
*Description: Stores user account and profile information.*

| Field Name     | Data Type | Description                                   |
| :------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | string    | Automatically generated by Firestore          |
| `name`         | string    | Full name of the user                         |
| `email`        | string    | User's email address (unique)                 |
| `passwordHash` | string    | Hashed password for authentication            |
| `phoneNumber`  | string    | User's contact phone number                   |
| `role`         | string    | User's role (e.g., 'customer', 'admin')       |

*(You would create a similar table for each collection listed in your `database_schema.json` file, like `products`, `orders`, `branches`, etc., including details for sub-collections.)*

### Key Terminology for Firebase:

*   **Use "Collections" instead of "Tables":** In Firebase, data is organized into **collections**, not tables.
*   **Use "Documents" instead of "Rows":** Each item within a collection is called a **document**, not a row.
*   **Use "Fields" instead of "Columns":** The attributes within a document are called **fields**, not columns.

By following this guide, your database documentation will be comprehensive, easy to understand, and technically accurate for your Firebase project.
